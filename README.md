# CBC Week 01 Challenge: Horiseon Refactor

## Description

This project is the first challenge from the coding bootcamp from UC Berkeley.  The initial commit of the main branch is the code that was provided, and the challenge was to refactor the code to make it more maintainable, readable, and accessible.

Maintainability and readability allow future developers to spend less time deciphering code and more time fixing or improving it.  By thoughtfully laying out the semantic elements, the webpage can easily expand to provide more content with minimal or no need to touch the stylesheets.  Accessibility is key to ensuring websites are available to all possible customers and can even help with search engine optimization (SEO) to give webpages an edge in being found in searches.

The refactoring consisted of these major methodologies:
- Combine redundant classes into a reusable class.
- Replace non-semantic elements like `<div>` that provide no context for Browser Readers, SEO, or developers and replace with semantic elements.
- Create a more readable code by adding comments explaining the purpose of major blocks of code.

## Installation

There is no installation process for this project.  It is already deployed at:

https://jdempe.github.io/bootcamp-01-horiseon-refactor/

## Usage

At the top right of the page in the header, navigation links will redirect the user to the related text lower on the page.  There are no other interactive features on the page.

## Mock Up

The mock up below was provided in the Bootcamp Homework materials.  The homework criteria required that the refactoring left all functionality and at least 90% of the visual elements intact.

### Resources
The below resources contributed to the decisions made on how to most effectively refactor the webpage.
- The original code for this refactor was provided by the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp, ran by edX Boot Camps LLC.

- [Brett Jankord](https://github.com/bjankord) provided an in depth look at when and how to use HTML class names in [this](https://www.brettjankord.com/blog/thoughts-on-semantic-html-class-names-and-maintainability/) blog post.

- [David MacDonald](https://twitter.com/davidmacd) explained the best way to provide accessibility alt text to a background image in [this](http://www.davidmacd.com/blog/alternate-text-for-css-background-images.html) blog post.

- W3 Schools has many in depth tutorials.  Their [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) on semantic elements was referenced heavily in refactoring.
